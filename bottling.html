		<p>Bottling your home brew is <em>awesome!!!</em> not only will you have a drink on demand; but you can also share it with friends and family whenever and whereever. I like to give out bottles to people as a way of saying 		   thanks for favors, or when people show an interest in my hobby. Here we will discuss some of the, pros & cons, of bottling, some of the difficulties and how you can overcome them, and proper storage after the bottling 		   process. To begin you will need the following
		<ul>
		    <li>Bottling bucket</li>
		    <li>Bottles</li>
		    <li>Siphoning kit</li>
		    <li>Bottling wand</li>
		    <li>Hydrometer equipment</li>
		</p>
		<h2> The Pre-Game</h2>
		<h3><img src="Cleaning.jpg" alt="Bottle cleaning" width="450" height="300"></h3><br>
		<p>As stated previously many times sanitation is <em>KEY</em>. This tends to make bottling a hassle, as you have to clean and sanitize each bottle, and all the equipment that will be used. unfortunately you can't just 		   throw your items in with the rest of the dirty dishes and use commercial detergent, this can lead to residual soap being left behind and a funky tatse or worse. So for reasons of health and simplicity washing your 		   bottles by hand may be the way to go, but you will need some sort of sanitizing agent. The Dark Cloud Brewers use a water and bleach mixture; but there are other agents that can be used just be sure to do the research 		   and follow the instructions. If you decide to go with our method here at the Dark Cloud Brewers, you will need plain household bleach with no aromas, or additives. Next you should fill the basin of a sink with a water 		   and bleach solutions, the amount of bleach will depend on the amount of bottles being sanitized. Once the basin if filled enough to fit the bottles (be sure not to over fill as there will be displacement as you add 		   bottles), be sure fill every bottle with the solution and allow contact time for proper sanitation. This will take about 30 minutes or so, so put on a good show and relax unti you are ready to soak the next round. Note 		   not necessary; but advised remove labels before the sanitation process, the labels will decrease the effectiveness of the solution much faster and will require you to change out the solution more often.</p>
		<p>After the contact time for the sanitation solution has been reached, you will need to rinse out the bottles. It should go without saying; but bleach water is not good for you or the beer, so be sure to thouroughly 		   	   rinse out every bottle. We usually do a triple rinse of every bottle to ensure that no residue is left behind, now it is time to dry. Air drying is our preferred method, as you can probably tell this is a long process 			   so don't expect to sanitize and bottle the same day. To help keep your counter-tops tidy it is recommended that you purchase or build a <a href="https://brewyourownbrew.com/shop/45-bottle-drainer-tree/">"Bottle-		   		   Tree"</a>, this will also come in handy when you actually get to the bottling process.</p> 
		<h2>The Main Event</h2>
		<p>So you finished sanatizing everything, all your equipment has been rinsed thouroughly and dried over night. You are ready to bottle your brew, you will first need to create a simple syrup using the priming sugar that 		   	   should come with any kit, once you have your simple syrup add it to the bottling bucket (<em>Note: Make sure your pouring spout on your bottling buck is closed before tranferring liquid into bucket</em>). Once the 			   simple syrup has been added you are ready to transfer your beer from the secondary fermentation carboy, to the bottling bucket (<em>Note: Remember to make sure not to siphon out the residue on the bottom</em>). From 		   	   here on out, it is recommended you enlist a second pair of hands. once the beer has been transferred you will need need to attach the a hose one side to the bottling wand, and the other to the spigot of the bottling 		   bucket. You will be using gravity to fill the bottles, so make sure the bottling buck is always above the where you will be bottling. We here at The Dark Cloud Brewers prefer to fill the bottles and immediately cap, so
		   having an extra body is extremely useful. once you have your bottles in place, and your bucket raised above the bottling location you are ready to go. Open the spigot located toward the bottom of the bottling bucket, 		   and place the bottling wand into you bottle. As you fill the bottle try to get as much liquid as you can while keeping the wand at the bottom of the bottle, this will ensure an even amount is being held in every bottle
		   without over filling. <em>DO NOT TRY TO FILL THE BOTTLE 100%</em>, when the bottle is full and you remove the bottling wand you will want to keep the displacement from the wand intact. Over-filling your bottles can 		   cause them to explode while they are carbonating. Once you are done filling the bottle (or bottles) you are ready to cap, either hand the bottle off to your capper or place it in an are where capping can be done at a 		   later time. Below is a video to help walk you through the bottling and capping process, please give it a watch before attempting if you are unsure of the process.</p>
