		    Here on this page, I'd like to talk about various game ideas. Some exmples being puzzles, riddles, and tactics my players have used to complete their 
		    goals during my D&D campaigns.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		    I'll also be using this page to discuss many of my favorite videogames, and like the idea with my "Movie" tab I will be adding a new horror themed game
		    weekly. I'd like to explain why I chose that game, and why it left a lasting impression with me.

        <h3> Table Top Gaming </h3>

		    So starting off as a GM (Game Master) was intimidating. How do I find people to play with? How do I find people I want to play with? It was difficult;
		    because there is a stereotype that everyone that plays table-top games are socially awkward and weird. Well it's kind of true; but that being said they 
		    are usually very creative and imaginative. I encourage everyone to at least give it a shot, if not to play at least sit and watch. Below I'll list some 
		    links to some really good youtube posts with famous celebrities playing D&D that might help you decide to join a campaign.
