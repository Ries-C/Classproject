		   The picture above is an IPA I have going, it is on it's primary fermentation. The yeast doesn't really like fluctuating temperature so we have it in the Kegorator 
		   to maintain a constant, cool temperature. The first thing to know about brewing is that <strong> SANITATION </strong> is the name of the game. Keeping your equipment
		   clean will keep you from experiencing a funky taste, and will keep you from getting sick. Also it's just good house keeping to thouroghly clean your
		   stuff after each batch, as it will prevent your lines from getting gummed up or developing a blockage. Come back next week for tip number two, where
		   I will explain some pitfalls my wife and I fell into.

		  Welcome back! We already touched on sanitation and maintaining proper temperature. Today I'd like to talk about transferring your brew from primary to secondary 
		  fermentation. First I'd like to point out the reason why this is necessary, and that is to remove waste from the primary fermentation and to promote further 
		  fermentation. The first reason is very important as this helps to clarify your brew and mitigate cloudiness, the second part is also important as you don't want
		  want whatever remaining yeast to get contaminated by the waste of the primary fermentation. As you can see there is a video to the right that will walk any new 
		  brewers through the process of transferring their batch from primary to secondary fermentation. Although I <em>DO NOT</em> agree with their method of sanitization,
		  I will say "different strokes for differnt folks".
