		  <p>I came up with the idea of Valhalla's gate as a way to combine two of my favorite things. Gaming and drinking; but there is a lot more to 
		     it than that. Valhalla's gate is a way for people to get out, meet other gamers, and hopefully form lasting friendships outside their immediate party.
		     It all started on my last deployment in Al Udeid, Qatar. I grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons with my family, but I was nervous to ask people I work
		     with to play. While I was packing I looked over and on my wifes nightstand was the players manual (she is still rather new), I decided I would take my 
		     books and dice with me and casually try to see if anyone would be interested. Side note I DO NOT FACEBOOK, but if I had... Turns out there were several 
		     groups meeting up to play several days a week. I started asking around my co-workers and had a few people show interest. We started as a party of 4, and
                     after a month or so we grew to a party of 8. So where does the drinking come in? Well After about 2-3 months my players wound up in a jail cell as players
                     are want to do. I had a really cool idea, where I would put their characters on trial; but I knew I couldn't do it cause I knew everything and it had to 
                     be impartial. I visited a few of the other games throughout the week to enlist the help of other players, or Dungeon Masters. Everyone loved my idea!..., 
		     but they didn't feel comfortable roleplaying in front of others they didn't know. I just knew with the right amount of "courage" it could have been an 
                     epic night.
