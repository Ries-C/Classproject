		<!-- The "Title" section is used to place a nameholder on the so as to be easily identified when multiple tabs are open -->
		<!-- The "Style" section is used to change portions of the page e.i. fonts, colors, etc, --> 
		<!-- I set the background to a pleasing grey that I think will fit in nicely for the theme. and the teal "border-bottom" makes for a nice offset -->
		<!-- The "Body" section contains the various images, and texts contained within the web page -->
		<!-- I have omitted my logo for the time being; because I can't get it to show on Github. I will add it in later assignments once I get more info -->
